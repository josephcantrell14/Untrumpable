# Untrumpable
This is the code base for my first Godot game, Untrumpable.  This is a 2D game programmed using GDScript as I followed the official tutorial for Godot Engine at https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/getting_started/step_by_step/index.html.

Untrumpable's page and playable HTML5 are on my personal website here, and it can also be found on Newgrounds.com:
https://josephcantrell.org/games/untrumpable.php
https://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/771250

Untrumpable is also downloadable from itch.io and Google Play:

Feel free to use this code however you please, but if you redistribute it or benefit, please credit me!
